              Hi! My name is Haeeun (Mina) Yun and I am currently a junior at Canyon Crest Academy. When my family and I first moved to the US from South Korea in 2014, I was suddenly pushed into an unfamiliar environment, one where my native language became useful only back at home. As a first grader joining her class just a few months before the school year ended, I often felt excluded and cut out from the rest of my classmates.
            </p>
                        <p class="aboutp">

                          With the language barrier and my reserved personality, it was especially difficult to form friendships or even communicate with my teacher. Growing up in a white-majority community also certainly did not help with my confidence or self-esteem, as I was frequently questioned by my peers about the lunches my mother packed me and my distinct accent. Though these matters may not seem all too big of a deal today, it was undoubtedly one of the most worrisome times of my early childhood.
            </p>

                <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6 mycol" data-aos="fade-right">
                        <p class="aboutp mt-md-4">
Inevitably, I began developing insecurities starting from the first grade, which continued to pile up throughout middle school. What was most difficult for me, however, was trying to fit into both Western and Asian expectations, two very different customs and cultures. Fitting in one standard meant I was falling out of the other, and I constantly sought for a way to satisfy both norms. I should provide further context here that when growing up, I always strove to please the people around me. Having someone lose faith or think lowly of me was a constant fear of mine, and I often went to far measures just to ensure that I was still accepted.
            </p>
                        <p class="aboutp">
I truly believe that the experiences I had when I first moved to the United States played a key role in shaping the way I came to view others and in the way I set standards for myself.  Even as I entered high school, where I was no longer ashamed but proud of my background, I continued to experience the same paranoia and apprehensiveness that I felt years back.
            </p>

          <div class="col-lg-6  mycol content" data-aos="fade-left">
            <p class="aboutp mt-md-4">
All of these factors, one by one, led me to feel excessive stress and worry about the way other people viewed me. It was nothing but a negative and overwhelming period.            </p>
                        <p class="aboutp">

By placing such a big emphasis on the way my peers thought about me, I couldnâ€™t help but take notice of even the smallest details on my surroundings. Self-image and acceptance was something I struggled heavily with, and still do to this day, yet I have finally come to agreeable terms with myself, and I hope to encourage the same for others. Through this website, I wish for nothing but the best for the individuals who choose to use it, and I am more than happy to lend a listening ear or whatever it may be that they need at the moment.            </p>

                        <p class="aboutp">
Mental health is without a doubt one of those areas that are frequently overlooked. With that said, I hope to contribute to the effort of breaking down the stigma that surrounds it, bringing it more into public view and acceptance.
